Task 3:

For students using Matlab, please call the task3_matlab script either from the command window or editor. 
For Python use the task3_python.py. Check the Python tutorial for help with getting started and overall syntax.


Task 4:
In Matlab, the data is described within the framework (try 'help wine_dataset').

For Python a shorter description below:

Wine Data Set:

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The attributes are (dontated by Riccardo Leardi, riclea '@' anchem.unige.it )
1) Alcohol
2) Malic acid
3) Ash
4) Alcalinity of ash
5) Magnesium
6) Total phenols
7) Flavanoids
8) Nonflavanoid phenols
9) Proanthocyanins
10)Color intensity
11)Hue
12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13)Proline
14)CLASS / Type of Wine

In a classification context, this is a well posed problem with "well behaved" class structures.
